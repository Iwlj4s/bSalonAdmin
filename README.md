3. Use this command:

```
curl -O -L https://github.com/Iwlj4s/bSalonAdmin/tree/master/setup/ElegansAdminSetup.exe
```


*  `-O`  You can change on ` -o file_name_you_want.exe `


* `-L` means "follow location" and is used to have curl automatically follow redirects when downloading a file. Some URLs can be configured to redirect to other URLs, and the -L option allows curl to automatically follow these redirects and retrieve the file from the final location.
